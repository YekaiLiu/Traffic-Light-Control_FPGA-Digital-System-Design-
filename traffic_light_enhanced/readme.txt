      ByteBlaster(TM) II download cables
   -  Serial port for MasterBlaster communications cable

Memory requirements/recommendations
-----------------------------------
A full installation of the Altera Complete Design Suite version 7.1
requires approximately 5 GB of available disk space on the drive 
or partition where you are installing the Altera Complete Design 
Suite and approximately 30 MB of available space on the drive that
contains your TEMP directory (Windows only).

The Quartus II Stand-Alone Programmer requires a minimum of 1 GB
of RAM plus additional memory based on the size and number of SOF
files and the size and number of devices being configured.

Altera recommends that your system be configured to provide swap
space (virtual memory) equal to the recommended physical RAM that
is required to process your design.

The following table shows the memory required to process designs
targeted for Altera devices:

Device                                   Recommended Physical RAM
                                         32-bit            64-bit
